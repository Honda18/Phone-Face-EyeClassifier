# Phone/Face/Eye Classifier
A haar cascade classifier that can detect smart phones, as well as faces and eyes from a live feed

Personally made the smart phone haar cascade, while the face and eye haar cascades are Opencv's products

Respository includes the following:

1. Scripts to gather negative images, clean them, and make their description files incase you want to make your own haar cascade

2. Main script that deploys the classifier

3. Xml files for haar cascades used

4. Trial images
